# CS-230 Module 7 Final Project

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Game Room had a successful Android-based game called Draw It or Lose it. The game is similar to the well-known "Pictionary" parlor game.
The company wanted to develop the game further so that it could run across a distributed network and allow people to play through web browsers
as well as most mobile devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did a particularly good job of creating and describing the UML diagram for the game and explaining the platform evaluation. I believe
my explanations were clear and would be generally understood by someone who does not have a technical background.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was a great way to plan out what the client wanted as well as the best way to achieve the right results.
It not only helps to keep the client informed, but serves as a general roadmap as work is being done to make sure that everything remains on
target during planning, development, and testing.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would rewrite the executive summary and design constraints sections. I feel that what I submitted was good, but now, having completed the entire
document, I believe that I could write these sections to be more clear and concise.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to put myself in the place of someone who would be playing the game and think about what they would expect to see and how they would the game
to work. It's important to consider the end user with any product because if the user does not have a good experience, they're not going to use the 
product. As, the saying goes, you only get one chance to make a first impression. Especially with computer software, your product has to make a good
impression of the users will just look for something.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My basic approach is to try to put together an idea of what I think the client or the client's end users would like to see. From there I would start to
plan the basic functionality of the software using techniques such as UML diagrams and pseudocode. Once I feel that I have everything basically mapped
out, I would begin working with an agile project management approach. I would carry out the actual development in increments, giving the client frequent
updates, showing how things currently work, and incorporating feedback into each iteration until the project is completed.
